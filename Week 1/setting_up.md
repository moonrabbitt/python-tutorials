## Setting Up Conda

[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is an open-source package management and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It lets you easily create, manage, and switch between different project environments with different Python versions and package sets.

### Creating a New Conda Environment

To create a new environment, use:

```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.8
```

Replace `myenv` with your desired environment name and `3.8` with your preferred Python version.

## Activating Conda Environment

After creating your environment, you need to activate it to use it.

### On the Terminal

Run the following command:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

Replace `myenv` with your environment name.

### In VS Code

VS Code can automatically detect and offer to activate Conda environments. This is handy for integrating your environment directly with your IDE.

## Using VS Code with Conda

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular IDE for Python development. It can integrate with Conda environments seamlessly.

### Activating Environment in VS Code

When you open a project in VS Code, it may prompt you to activate the Conda environment. Alternatively, you can select the Python interpreter from the bottom-right corner, which corresponds to your Conda environment.

You can find a video of how to do this [here](pics/select_kernel_vscode.mov). (Note: It's a video file so you might have to open it from your finder or files browser window. It is saved in Week 1/pics/ select_kernel_vscode.mov)

### Difference Between Terminal and VS Code Activation

- **Terminal Activation**: This is universal and works in all shell environments. You need to do this every time you open a new terminal.
- **VS Code Activation**: It's specific to your project in VS Code. It ensures that the correct environment is used for linting, debugging, and running code within the IDE.

### When to Use Which?

- **Use Terminal Activation** when running scripts or managing packages outside VS Code.
- **Use VS Code Activation** for development within the VS Code environment to ensure consistency.

## Installing Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebooks are an interactive computational environment, in which you can combine code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots, and rich media.

To install Jupyter Notebook in your Conda environment:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
```

## Understanding Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks differ from scripts in that they allow a more interactive development experience. They are ideal for data analysis, visualization, and exploratory programming.

## Launching Jupyter outside of VSCode

Sometimes, you might prefer to work with Jupyter Notebooks outside of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code. Launching Jupyter Notebooks independently offers a more focused interface and can be more resource-efficient.

### Steps to Launch Jupyter Notebook

1. **Open the Terminal**: Start by opening your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Activate Your Conda Environment**: If you're using a Conda environment, make sure to activate it:

    ```bash
    conda activate myenv
    ```

    Replace `myenv` with the name of your Conda environment.

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
   
    Run the following command:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    This command launches Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.

4. **Navigate to Your Project Folder**: In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the directory where your project files are located.

5. **Create or Open a Notebook**: You can create a new notebook or open an existing one from this interface.

### Benefits of Using Jupyter Outside VSCode

- **Simplified Interface**: Jupyter outside of VSCode offers a streamlined, notebook-focused interface.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Running Jupyter independently can sometimes be less resource-intensive than running it within an IDE.
- **Easy Access to Notebook Features**: All Jupyter features and extensions are readily available in this standalone mode.

### Considerations

- **File Access**: Ensure that the Jupyter Notebook has access to the files and folders needed for your project.
- **Environment Consistency**: If using a specific Python environment, remember to launch Jupyter from that environment to maintain package and Python version consistency.


### How is a Notebook Different from a Script?

- **Jupyter Notebook - .ipynb**: Interactive, supports inline comments and media, great for visualization and exploratory analysis. Supports running each cell at a time. More difficult to use with debugger but cell by cell execution can help with debugging.

- **Python Script - .py**: Linear execution of code, more suitable for final, production-ready projects. Allows import of functions into other scripts or notebooks. Runs entire script at once. Easier to use with debugger.

## Installing Additional Python Libraries and Packages

Expanding your Python project often requires the installation of additional libraries and packages. This section not only covers how to install these packages using both Jupyter Notebooks and the terminal but also explains what packages and libraries are in the context of Python programming.

### What are Packages?

In Python, a **package** is a collection of modules. A module is simply a file containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables. These modules are organized into packages, which can be imported and used in your Python scripts or projects. Packages are essentially directories with Python files and a file named `__init__.py`. 

### What are Libraries?

A **library** in Python is a collection of modules or packages. It's a broader term that encompasses packages and provides a set of utilities for a specific purpose, like data analysis, image processing, or web development. For example, `numpy` and `pandas` are popular libraries for numerical computing and data analysis, respectively.

### Why Use Packages and Libraries?

- **Code Reusability**: Libraries and packages allow you to use code that has already been written, tested, and optimized by others, saving you time and effort.
- **Efficiency**: Many libraries are optimized for performance, offering efficient implementations of operations that could be time-consuming and complex to write from scratch.
- **Community Support**: Popular Python libraries are supported by large communities, providing documentation, tutorials, and forums for troubleshooting.
- **Feature-Rich**: Libraries often come with a wide range of features that can simplify complex tasks in data processing, machine learning, etc.

### Installing Packages

You can install packages in Python using package managers like `pip` (Python's package installer) or Conda. 

#### Using Jupyter Notebooks

In Jupyter Notebooks, you can install packages directly within the notebook environment using the `!` command:

```python
!pip install numpy


### In Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks allow you to install packages directly within the notebook environment.

#### Using the `!` Command

To install a package in a Jupyter Notebook, you can use the `!` command followed by `pip` or `conda`. For example:

```python
!pip install numpy
```

or

```python
!conda install -c conda-forge numpy
```

This command is run as if it's in the terminal. It affects the current Jupyter kernel and the underlying environment.

### In the Terminal

Installing packages through the terminal is straightforward and affects the environment globally.

#### Using Conda

With Conda, you can install packages specifically for the activated environment. For instance:

```bash
conda install numpy
```

This installs the `numpy` package in the currently active Conda environment.

### When to Use Which?

- **Use Jupyter Notebooks** for quick, on-the-fly installations within a specific notebook. This method is useful for exploratory data analysis or when working on specific projects in a Jupyter environment.
- **Use the Terminal** for more permanent installations that you want available across multiple projects or notebooks. This method ensures that the package is available every time you activate the Conda environment.

### Understanding the Difference

- **Jupyter Notebook Installation**: Affects only the specific notebook's kernel/environment. Ideal for temporary or project-specific installations.
- **Terminal Installation**: Affects the entire Conda environment. Best for packages you'll use across multiple projects or notebooks.

## Finding Installation Commands for Python Packages

When you need to find installation commands for various Python packages, here are some reliable sources:

#### PyPI (Python Package Index)

- **Website**: [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)
- **Description**: Official repository for Python packages. Provides `pip install` commands.

#### Conda Package Index

- **Website**: [Conda Package Index](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo)
- **Description**: Repository for Conda-compatible packages. Includes Conda installation commands.

#### GitHub Repositories

- **Usage**: Check the `README.md` or the `requirements.txt` of a package's GitHub repository.
- **Description**: Many Python packages provide installation instructions in their GitHub repositories.



Remember, always verify the source and ensure the instructions are compatible with your Python version and operating system.
